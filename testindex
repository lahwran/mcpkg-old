Version: 1.2_02 2 file:///home/blendmaster/workspace/Patcher/modloader.mcpkg
Description: Relatively small api for the most common mod functions 
A mod, kind of like a mod manager, that stops conflicts with mods 
that alter rendering, recipes, add entities, gui, smeltables or fuel. 

If you're a modder, feel free to decompile this and learn how to make 
mods work with it. Inherit BaseMod and override any functions as 
necessary. The mod's main class file should be prefixed with 'mod_'. 

Support for 303's modifications is included. In addition, texture packs are 
supported for override images and chunk population hook was added.

#Depends: modloader
#Description: adds four new types of arrows; explosive arrows, fire arrows, ice arrows, and a joke weapon, egg arrows.
#They are crafted the same way as normal arrows, but the head is replaced based on the element; 
#gunpowder for explosive, coal for fire, snowball for ice, and egg for, well, egg. 
#Crafting an explosive arrow only gives you one arrow, and it explodes upon impact. 
#Crafting a fire arrow gives you one arrow, that will ignite stuff upon impact. 
#Crafting an ice arrow gives you one arrow, that will freeze water into ice, 
#lava springs into obsidian, put out fire, and break torches. 
#Egg arrows spawn chickens upon impact with the ground, but there's a secret too. 
#Includes custom icons for the arrows! Homing bow recipe is same layout as regular bow,
#but diamond instead of sticks.
