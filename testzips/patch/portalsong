This was a FAILURE.
I'm making a note here: HUGE SEXESS.
It's hard to overstate my INDEGESTION.
Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we CRAP.
For the good of all of us.
Except the ones who're in bed.
But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
You just keep on flying till you run out of cake.
And the Science gets done.
And you bake a neat gun.
For the people who are still alive.
I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you broke my heart.
And grilled me.
And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into a fire.
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!
Now these parts of burger make a beautiful line.
And we're out of ketchup.
We'll be eating on time.
So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are still alive.
Go ahead and leave me.
I think I prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
Maybe Black Mesa
THAT WAS A JOKE.
HAHA. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
Look at me still talking
when there's Science to do.
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
I've experiments to run.
There is research to be done.
On the people who are still alive.
And believe me I am still alive.
I'm doing Science and I'm still alive.
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.
While you're dying I'll be still alive.
And when you're dead I will be still alive.
STILL ALIVE
