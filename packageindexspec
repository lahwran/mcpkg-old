#format of the version subsection
#MCVersion uses comparison format described below, packageversion is an arbitrary string.
#uses order to determine which version is newer than which. use a dash ('-') character
#if this version has no mod version - for example the first release of modloader for a mcversion.
#internally will assign number based on sort order.
#url must be direct - mediafire, for example, cannot be used for this. dropbox+bit.ly, however, can.

#dependency cycles: be careful what you put in these fields. if a dependency cycle is detected, the mod install will abort!
#I will be writing a checker function that downloads the lists and checks for loops.


#absolute dependency, package will not be installed if any depends package installs failed
#if omitted, assumes no depends
Depends: <PackageList>

#if included, specifies packages that this package must be installed before, if those are being installed

#if included, specifies packages that this package must be installed after, if those are being installed
InstallAfter: <PackageList>

#This declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency.
#"The Recommends field should list packages that would be found together with this one in all but unusual installations."
Recommends: <PackageList>

# like Recommends and Depends, but will never be installed automatically
#"This is used to declare that one package may be more useful with one or more others. 
# Using this field tells the packaging system and the user that the listed packages are
# related to this one and can perhaps enhance its usefulness, but that installing 
# this one without them is perfectly reasonable."
Suggests: <PackageList>

#"This field is similar to Suggests but works in the opposite direction.
# It is used to declare that a package can enhance the functionality of another package."
Enhances: <PackageList>

#refuse to activate this package to install if a package on this list is activated.
#only for when there is a known incompatibility with a mod that doesn't change the same class files

#PackageList format:
<Package1>, <Package2>, <PackageN>

#PackageN format:
<PackageName>:<MC Version comparison>/<Package Version comparison>

#you can omit the mc version as such:
<PackageName>[comparison]<Package Version>
#in which case, it will assume the MC Version Comparison used on your mod

#Version Comparison format:
=
!=

#these comparisons may be used in range versions, as well as on their own:
>=
<=
>
<

#uses of comparisons
Version[comparison]x[comparison]Version
[comparison]Version

#special version:
^ means the first version of specified mod that fits within the range given for mcversion; $ means the last.

#examples:
1.2<=x<1.3 in a mc version means that it has to be 1.2.
>=1.1 in the package version means (fairly obviously) anything after 1.1 or 1.1 itself
>=^ in the package version means any version of this package that works for specified range of minecraft versions.
^>=x<1.5 in the package version means anything that works for this mc version up to 1.5

#will normally install latest version that matches comparison, unless specified otherwise. gui will have no option to do this. cli only.
